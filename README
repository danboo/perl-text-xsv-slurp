Text-xSV-Slurp

Text::xSV::Slurp converts between xSV data and a variety of nested data
shapes, allowing both column and row filtering using user defined functions.

This brief example creates an array of hashes from a file, where each array
record corresponds to a line of the file, and each line is represented as a hash
of header-to-value pairs.

    use Text::xSV::Slurp 'xsv_slurp';
    
    my $aoh = xsv_slurp( 'foo.csv' );
    
    ## if foo.csv contains:
    ##
    ##   uid,name
    ##   342,tim
    ##   939,danboo
    ##
    ## then $aoh contains:
    ##
    ##   [
    ##     { uid => '342', name => 'tim' },
    ##     { uid => '939', name => 'danboo' },
    ##   ]
