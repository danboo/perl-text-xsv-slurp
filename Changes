Revision history for Text-xSV-Slurp

0.22    Sun Jan 29 2009
        - use $csv->getline() to parse headers
        - added error checking to all $csv->getline() calls

0.21    Sun Nov  1 2009
        - speed enhancements:
           - use Text::CSV->getline() for combined readline/parse/array_ref operation
           - hoh on_store/on_collide handler argument passing is now array based
             with named constants, saving from unpacking @_ into an option hash
             in a very tight loop

0.20    Sun Nov  1 2009
        - added support for predefined on_store/on_collide handlers to the hoh
          shape, allowing the user to specify how values should be aggregated
          when the key does result in unique values

0.12    Sun Oct 18 2009
        - tests do not explicitly import xsv_slurp in order to test that it is
          exported by default

0.11    Sun Oct 18 2009
        - export xsv_slurp by default
        - remove mention of converting data to xSV format from SYNOPSIS

0.10    Sun Oct 18 2009
        - initial release
